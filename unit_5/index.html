<h2>What's it all about?</h2>
<p>
Make it simple, yet significant.

</p>
<p>

Curious. Passionate. Thoughtful. I find new inspiration in everyday life. When starting a new project, I look to related behavior in the day to day. It seems like a simple and obvious tactic but, is often overlooked.

Hailing from the middle, I was born and raised in a southern Illinois town.  Then spending my college and introductory years into adulthood in Chicago. A sudden and abrupt realization of my distaste for winter, I migrated west.  I live and work in Los Angeles with my dog Bagel.
